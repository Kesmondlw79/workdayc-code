Integrating two systems, like Workday and another application (e.g., a custom database, an ERP system, or a CRM), using C# can be an excellent showcase for your skills. 

Typically, integrations involve APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or web services, so your portfolio can demonstrate your ability to interact with these systems and transfer data between them.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might approach integrating Workday (which offers RESTful APIs) with another system (e.g., a SQL database or another external service) using C#:

Example: Integrating Workday with a SQL Database using C#

Workday API: Workday exposes APIs that allow you to interact with their system. These APIs usually require OAuth authentication, and the responses are typically in JSON format.

SQL Database: You can store the data retrieved from Workday in a local or cloud-based SQL database, which might be useful for reporting or further processing.

Key Concepts Demonstrated in This Example:

Calling RESTful APIs: Using HttpClient to send GET requests to the Workday API. The code handles authentication via OAuth using a bearer token.

Parsing JSON: The response from the Workday API is in JSON format. The JsonSerializer class is used to parse the response into C# objects.

SQL Integration: Connecting to a SQL Server database using SqlConnection and inserting data retrieved from Workday into a database using SqlCommand.

Asynchronous Programming: Using async and await for non-blocking operations, making the API call and database insertion process more efficient.

Error Handling: The code can be extended to handle errors more effectively, such as invalid API responses or database connection issues.

Basic C# Code for Integrating Workday and SQL Database

This example demonstrates:

Calling a Workday API to fetch employee data.

Parsing the JSON response.
